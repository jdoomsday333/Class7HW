I would like to than TheoWaf for creating this community and giving us the opportunity to learn cloud and make and income that would allow us to escape the matrix and live free. I would also like to thank my group leader PassportOG for helping me and my group. I would have never been able to get my GitHub repo up without his help.

My hobby is riding motorcycles and flying drones. I am in Thailand and I rented a scooter to travel around. I also just passed my drone pilots license so I can legally fly my DJI drone in Pattaya. Stay tuned for my footage on YouTube.
I would be happy making 150,000 USD in a remote cloud job, while living in Thailand.
